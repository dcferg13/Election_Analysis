## Election-Audit Summary
In this election audit we made a script to read the election dataset in a more comprehensive matter. We gathered information on the number of votes cast for each candidate, what percentage of the votes the candidates received, and the winner based on the popular vote. The script can be used again across the state for all the local congressional elections. A modified script could be used to find out how many people are registered to vote and how many of them voted. Another modification we would do is to find out the age, gender, and race of the voters.
